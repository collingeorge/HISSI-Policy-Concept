# HISSI Pilot Program Funding Memo
## Concept Draft — October 2025

#### Objective
Launch a $500 million pilot to establish the first trusted humanoid manufacturing hubs and the Humanoid Test & Evaluation Center (HTEC) under the proposed Humanoid Industrial Security & Standards Initiative (HISSI).

#### Purpose
Demonstrate secure, domestic assembly and validation of logistics humanoids within 24 months, leveraging modular open systems design, signed AI firmware, and supply-chain attestation per DoDI 5200.44 and NIST SP 800-161.

#### Program Elements
1. Establish two Trusted Manufacturing Hubs (TMHs) co-located with existing DoD robotics facilities or university consortia.
2. Stand up one Humanoid Test & Evaluation Center (HTEC) with red-team capability, firmware signing infrastructure, AI provenance verification, and continuous C-SCRM monitoring per NIST SP 800-161.
3. Fund pilot humanoid production runs for non-lethal logistics applications under DoD supervision.

#### Budget Breakdown
- $250M — Facility upgrades and equipment for TMHs.
- $150M — Establishment of HTEC and cybersecurity infrastructure.
- $100M — Grants and contracts for prototype humanoid manufacturing under HISSI standards.

#### Deliverables & Metrics

| Deliverable | Timeline | Metric |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| Two TMHs    | FY2027  | Operational, 50% domestic HCCs |
| One HTEC    | FY2028  | Accredited, zero vulnerabilities |
| Prototypes  | FY2027  | Logistics humanoids deployed |

#### Outcome
This pilot establishes proof-of-concept for secure humanoid manufacturing and testing frameworks, paving the way for full-scale HISSI implementation by 2030. Congress and DoD should fund this $500M pilot in FY2026 to secure the U.S. robotics edge, aligning with Replicator and CHIPS Act priorities.
